The intensive course on database fundamentals acquaints students with one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server.
The course gives significant attention to the relational model, data modeling using ER diagrams (tables and relational connections), and working with the SQL language (data retrieval, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion, and insertion). 
Fundamental knowledge is provided for working with ACID transactions and transaction processing, along with practical tips for optimizing performance.
This course lays the groundwork for working with databases, making their use in real applications easier and aiding in understanding concepts like transforming databases into an object-oriented model (ORM).
